# ETHBCN HACKATHON

We created a ERC-721 without the Transfer function to make it Soul Bound Token. We used OpenZeppelin to understand the **functionality that** ERC-721 had. The Dynamic NFT is prepared to adds more Metadata Status and Lvl. to the Athlete. The federation Mints a ERC-712 to  validation and Identify the Athlete, and the Club Breeds the dNFT with the new token EXP.

# **ERC-5727: Semi-Fungible Soulbound Token**

### **An interface for soulbound tokens, also known as badges or account-bound tokens, that can be both fungible and non-fungible.**

# **ERC-4906: EIP-721 Metadata Update Extension**

### **Add a MetadataUpdate event to EIP-721.**

# ****ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Standard****

The three most important advantages of these technical features are enhanced ownership security through the ERC-721 standard, providing unique and personalized user experiences with Soul Bound Tokens, and enabling improved interoperability and efficiency with ERC-5727. Additionally, [Remix.org](http://remix.org/) empowers decentralized creativity and collaboration, facilitating innovative and collective creation within the community.
